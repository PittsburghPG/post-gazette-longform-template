# Pittsburgh Post-Gazette longform template

This responsive template makes assembling immersive longform stories a breeze. Right?!

## Basic workflow

1. Download .zip file from this Github page. 
2. Load the images you'll be using into the `/img` folder. (Make sure they're not too big! I usually export full-screen images at a max of 2000px wide.) 
3. Fill out `header.html` from `/html`; copy and paste into `index.html`.
4. Fill out `section.html` from `/html`; copy and paste into `index.html`; rinse and repeat for every section in the article.
